# What can farm be used for?

The farm HPC is a cluster of computers running Linux that uses
the [Slurm workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html)
to run compute jobs on many computers.

Farm can be used for many purposes. Here's a short list of some of the
technical possibilities:

- Running large data analyses and simulations in R and Python;
- Speeding up analyses using many CPUs
- Running analyses that need dozens to hundreds of GBs of RAM;
- Storing and analyzing large files (GBs to TBs in size);
- Running software that needs access to GPUs;
- Using software via the Linux command line;

There are many more, of course!
