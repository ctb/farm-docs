# :material-dna: Farm HPC

Farm is a high performance computing (HPC) cluster for the
[College of Agricultral and Environmental Sciences](https://caes.ucdavis.edu/)
at UC Davis.  Designed for both research and teaching, it is a
significant campus resource primarily for CPU and RAM-based computing,
with a wide selection of centrally-managed software available for
research in genetics, proteomics, and related bioinformatics
pipelines, weather and environmental modeling, fluid and particle
simulations, geographic information system (GIS) software, and more.

## Administration

Farm is maintained by the [HPC Core Facility](https://hpc.ucdavis.edu/about).
Software installation and support requests should be directed to [farm-hpc@ucdavis.edu](mailto:farm-hpc@ucdavis.edu).

## Using This Documentation

Before contacting Farm support, first try searching this
documentation.  This site provides information on accessing and
interacting with the cluster, an overview of available software
ecosystems, and tutorials for commonly used software and access
patterns. 
<!-- It is split into a **Users** section for end-users and an
**Admin** section with information relevant to system administators.
This documentation is being actively expanded as Franklin's software
and userbase grows.
